# Thing's I've done:  
(by Yasmeen Hassan)  

- Copied all the content from the public pages and translated them into Angular 2., all the content is in the typescript files.
- Created a slide show on the home page with various FJC centers, I’ve only added 3 images for 3 locations, the other images were low quality.
- Created an escape button that directs the user to a new tab and redirects the old page to google
- Built components for each Family Justice center, and routed them so that they’re only accessible through the tour page.
- The FAQ page is now a list of questions (buttons), so that when you click on a question, it reveals hidden answers
- deployed the website on Amazon Web service, http://ocdvportal.nyc The AWS account used for this was Tom's active directory group. 
- Changes to the live site are being done through git.


## Things that haven’t been done:

- Attach links to FJC centers, when you click on the time images on homepage slideshow 
- Improve escape button, have it redirect to multiple pages, so that it would take more than 10 clicks to go backwards.
- Each Family justice center has its own page, but lacks content
- When you click on FAQ questions, add a scroll effect to the text box answer.
- Pop-up box when you first enter the page, to highlight the escape key and it’s purpose and how to use it
- Tech safety tips page, the links available shouldn't be to other websites, instead we should have local links on the website with further information


## Mistakes I’ve made:

- Treated Angular 1 and 2 as one and the same. This application is coded with Angular 2.



## How to access web server:

- From your command line, paste this:

```bash
ssh -i "~/.ssh/ocdv.pem" ubuntu@ec2-13-59-78-136.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

- Once you’re virtually logged into the server
- the web-app folder is directly accessible and from there just update
- I used my git repo to push live changes




### ECSAPE KEY 
Panic button ideas:

- have the button along the side of the page, and when clicked the words on the page change

//here’s some example websites with the Escape key

Pro: 
you CANT go back, sometimes it doesn't work

Pro:
the button is places alongside the scroll bar
(has good content)

Con: 
button is too small 
history is still there
button is on the right side so its hard to click escape, while the scroll bar is visible

Pro:
disclosure as soon you as launch site
explains the escape button and its purpose
